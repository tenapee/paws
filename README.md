# General
This is a pet adoption site I created for a final project at Belmont University. It provides public users with resources and FAQs about general pet health and wellness. Registered members also have the ability to filter through the available pets. 

#Data
All pets are actually available for adoption, and I gathered my data from rescuegroups.org. I have an automatic script that updates MySQL weekly with any new pets. 

#Stack
The site is built on a traditional LAMP stack:
-Linux
-Apache tomcat server
-MySQL
-PHP

Of course, there is also some good 'ole JavaScript
